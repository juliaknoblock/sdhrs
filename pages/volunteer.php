            <h2 class="head2"><span>Foster a Rabbit</span></h2>

        <p>Fostering a rescued rabbit is a great way to save a life.  If you are not able to make a lifetime commitment to a rabbit at this time, then fostering may be a good fit for you.

        <p>San Diego HRS has an Adoption Center where the majority of its foster rabbits reside.  Foster homes are needed for those rabbits not yet ready for the adoption center floor or when space is not currently available.  Newly received rabbits may need some medical treatment before becoming available or more socialization.  Foster homes are also needed to care for mothers and newborns until they are old enough to become adopted.

        <p>Additionally, we sometimes have rabbits who need a break from the adoption center.  These rabbits can become depressed, frustrated, or angry and aggressive when they have to wait so long for a home.  Getting these bunnies into a foster home for a period of time can give them the one-on-one time and attention they deserve and help to turn their outlook into a positive one.

        <p>Foster parents work directly with the Adoptions Director regarding all aspects of their foster rabbit's care. We will occasionally allow a foster home to adopt their own foster rabbit but this is discouraged after one or two instances, as it creates an overload on the foster home and reduces our ability to take in rabbits needing to be saved.

        <p>Volunteers with rabbit experience are preferred, but we can train novices.  The important thing is that our foster homes follow the SDHRS Guidelines for rabbit care (please read our Rabbit Care section on this website).  We do expect our foster homes to follow our direction in the care of the rabbit(s), especially with regard to housing, food, and exercise time. Foster homes must agree to bring their rabbit to the Adoption Center for adoption appointments or once the Adoptions Director decides the rabbit can be moved permanently to the Center.  Foster home applicants who are new to rabbits must attend our Bunny 101 class.  If a foster home's rabbit experience has been in a very different environment than how SDHRS cares for its rabbits, they will also be asked to attend the Bunny 101.  This class is free to volunteers.  Classes are held Saturday mornings at 10:30 a.m.

        <p>We also have a need for Sanctuary homes.  These are foster homes that keep the rabbit for its lifetime.  Most rabbits are put into Sanctuary status because of a chronic behavior or medical issue that makes them not so adoptable.  The rabbit remains the property of SDHRS but lives with the volunteer for the remainder of its lifetime.  Many sanctuary homes fall in love with their sanctuary fosters and end up adopting them, but this is not at all expected.  We also need sanctuary homes that can care for special needs (disabled) rabbits.

        <p>FOSTERING GUIDELINES

        <p>Foster homes are people generally experienced in caring for rabbits, who have room in their homes to house, exercise, socialize, and care for a foster rabbit(s) until the rabbit is moved to the Adoption Center.  This is done in accordance with HRS guidelines for care, diet and handling (sanctuary homes keep the rabbit for its lifetime).
        <p>Requested minimum commitment is 2 months, but can last longer if their foster rabbit does not get adopted within that time period.  It can also be less, when the rabbit is moved to the Adoption Center and the foster family wants to take a break or stop fostering.
        <p>Foster rabbits are required to be housed in a separate pen or cage from a fosterer's own rabbits.  Each foster rabbit must get adequate run every day (two hours or so), in a safe, bunny proofed environment.
        <p>Foster rabbits are to live indoors only, preferably in an area of the home where they will get a lot of attention.  This serves to socialize them in preparation for a new home.
        <p>All foster homes are evaluated in advance, for their suitability for caring for foster rabbits, based on the environment.  For example of you had a dog with a high prey drive (a terrier, bird dog, Akita, etc.) it would not be safe for a rabbit.  Or, if you have young children, you might not have enough time to give (rabbits are like 2 year olds themselves).  Homes are evaluated for suitability on a case-by-case basis, by working with the interested volunteer to get an idea of their experience and room for housing.  We also review the environment (safe from overactive dogs, predators, etc.) and the foster parent's ability to handle the work load.  For example, if someone is disabled and cannot lift the litter box, or pen, it might not be a good match for their abilities.
        <p>Foster homes must be able to transport their rabbits to and from the vet (using HRS' contracted vets for care) and to adoption days as requested.  Having transportation is important.
        <p>SDHRS will provide a housing setup for the rabbit, along with basic supplies (litter box, food &amp; water bowls, etc.) and boxed hay. Foster homes are responsible for providing fresh greens daily and pellets (usually Oxbow Bunny Basics T, unless rabbit is young then an approved alfalfa pellet).  SDHRS can also provide some toys and other extras for foster bunnies.
        <p>HRS provides all vet care through its contracted vets.  The SDHRS Adoption Director manages all vet care and reviews all cases, making decisions on the level of vet care provided, in discussion with the foster home.  All vet visits must be approved in advance by the Adoptions Director, unless the situation is a "life or death" emergency.  In that case the rabbit should be immediately transported to an HRS-approved vet clinic and the Adoptions Director contacted as soon as possible.
        <p>Foster homes are required to bring their foster rabbits to adoption days, as needed, so they can have a chance at being adopted. The Adoptions Director does all adoption screenings and determines which rabbits are needed for adoption day, sending out email announcements in advance.  Foster homes must monitor their email for messages about upcoming adoption days.  Foster homes must provide feedback to the Adoptions Director on the personality, litter box traits, and behaviors of their foster rabbit.  This helps determine what types of homes are suitable for the rabbit. We need to know if the foster rabbit is good with children, other animals, or has any behavior issues or medical concerns.
        <p>Foster rabbits must have current photographs on file for use on adoption websites. Foster homes must either provide these photos or bring their rabbits to scheduled photos sessions at the Adoption Center (not necessary for sanctuary rabbits).
        <p>Rabbits are placed with foster homes usually based on the home's capabilities or willingness to take certains types of rabbits.  Some foster homes are good with medical care, some need easier bunnies, and some are great with behavioral issues.  The Adoptions Director is responsible for taking rabbits from shelters or other situations, and assigning them to foster homes.
        <p>Foster homes begin with only one or two rabbits.  Later, if they have become comfortable with the process and have room to take more, additional rabbits may be assigned to them by the Adoptions Director.
        <p>*** Any rabbit taken in by a foster home "without prior written permission of the Adoptions Director" becomes the personal property of that individual. SDHRS will not accept responsibility for that rabbit and will not cover any costs or medical treatment for the rabbit.
