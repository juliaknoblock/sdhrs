		<h2 class="head2"><span>Sponsor a Rabbit</span></h2>
			<p>Can't adopt, no time to volunteer but you still want to help? 

<p>It costs San Diego HRS $1 a day to care for each bunny. That's $30 a month per bunny. You can help us ensure that every bunny in our shelter lives comfortably until they find their forever home - through sponsorship. 

<p>For just $30 per month, you can sponsor a bunny at the Adoption Center. A sign will be placed on the bunny's pen designating you as his/her sponsor, you'll be sent updates and photos of your bunny and we'll let you know when he or she has been adopted. Bunny sponsors also enjoy giving birthday gifts to their bunnies or dropping off a toy or two at the holidays. It's up to you and how much you want to spoil your special shelter bunny. 

<p>To choose your bunny to sponsor, visit our adoptable bunnies page and choose a bun who does not already have a sponsor (the description will state if they are sponsored). Let us know who you would like to sponsor and we will make it happen! 

<p>To learn more about sponsorship email jennifer@sandiegorabbits.org or download the form below. We can make it easy to call a shelter bunny "your own!" 



			<p><a href="mailto:sponsor@sandiegorabbits.org?Subject=Sponsor" id="pagelink">Click here to e-mail for sponsorship</a>
 

			<p>or..... Go online to set up a recurring donation of $30 per month and name the bunny you wish to sponsor (use the "donation in honor of" space.) Be sure to complete your personal info (address, etc.) so we can send you information on your sponsored rabbit.

			<p>Note: Sponsorship of a shelter bunny also makes a great gift for someone who wants a bunny but cannot have one at this time. </p>

<p>Programs needing donations are: 

<p>Shelter Fund: We opened our rabbit-only shelter and Adoption Center in July, 2014. We need your support to care for the rabbits in our shelter, including funds to purchase hay, greens, pelleted food, and daily supplies. On top of these expenses, we incur approximately $7,500 in monthly fees for security and fire systems, electricity, insurance, and our rent. The majority of work is done by volunteers so your donation goes to rabbit care and our community support programs that help to get rabbits spayed or neutered, and to educate the community about responsible rabbit care. 

<p>Spay-Neuter Fund: This fund provides spay/neuter rebates to individuals in the community who get their rabbit altered. Donations to this fund actively support the lower of rabbit overpopulation and help keep rabbits in their homes. 

<p>Poppy's Fund: Named for a special rescue bunny, Poppy, this fund supports surgeries and extended medical care for rabbits who come to us with a debilitating injury or illness, but can be saved and go on to live quality lives. 

<p>First Giving will send you a receipt for your donation that you can turn in with your tax materials. Donations made to San Diego Companion Rabbit Society are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law. Our nonprofit ID number is 65-1262427.

<p>San Diego HRS Angels 

<p>The San Diego HRS Angels is a special group of San Diego HRS friends who have remembered San Diego HRS in their estate plan. These generous friends have made their gifts through bequests, retirement plans, or life insurance policies. Your estate plan gift will help build a strong heritage for San Diego HRS and ensure that we can continue our important rescue and educational work for generations to come. 

<p>San Diego HRS Angels' gifts to the San Diego HRS can be made in two ways: bequests through wills and trusts, and through retirement plans and life insurance policies. 

<p>Wills and Trusts 

<p>Bequests of all sizes are welcome. You may make a bequest of cash or securities by designating a specific dollar amount, a percentage of your estate, or a particular asset. A bequest is simple to arrange in consultation with your legal advisor. It is a revocable arrangement, enabling you to make alterations as your circumstances change. Moreover, a bequest to San Diego HRS will qualify your estate for an estate tax deduction as allowable by law.  Be sure to use our corporate name, San Diego Companion Rabbit Society.

<p>Sample Will Provision: "I give (____ dollars), (_____ percent of the residue of my estate) or (a specific asset) to San Diego Companion Rabbit Society." 

<p>Please be sure to speak with your estate planner or legal advisor to answer any questions you may have. 

<p>Life Insurance Policies 

<p>You may name San Diego HRS as the beneficiary of your IRA, 401(k), or other retirement plan or your life insurance policy. Such a gift is easy to arrange with help from your tax advisors. 

<p>Many people cannot donate as much as they might like to San Diego HRS at this time, but through remembering the San Diego HRS in your estate plans, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you can contribute to the future of this organization. 

<p>Because San Diego HRS is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, most gifts qualify for an income tax charitable deduction. As with all financial considerations, we encourage you to discuss potential tax advantages with your attorney, tax advisor, or financial consultant. 

<p>Our corporate name is: San Diego Companion Rabbit Society, Inc.  Our Federal EIN# is: 65-1262427 Look us up at www.guidestar.org 

<p>If you have questions, please contact, Patricia Mulcahy, at patricia@sandiegorabbits.org or 619-865-1294.
